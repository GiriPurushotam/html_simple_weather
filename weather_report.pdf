The weather web page, index.html, is a simple way to show live weather information. One of its strengths is that it clearly presents important weather details such as city name, date, temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a table format. The weather icon makes it easier to understand the conditions at a glance. The page is also visually clean and easy to read, making it accessible to users.
However, there are some weaknesses. One issue is that the page only displays weather for one city. It would be better if users could search for different cities. Also, if the API fails or there is no internet connection, the page does not handle errors wellâ€”it should show a message instead of an empty table.
Another limitation is that the page is not very interactive. Adding features like a search bar or a button to refresh data would improve the user experience.
Overall, the weather web page is simple and effective
